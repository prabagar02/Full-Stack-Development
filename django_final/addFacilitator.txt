Facilitor addition
--------------------
Added a new facilator named test1 that is not able to modify the questions like admin.
Username: test
password: test
email: test1@gmail.com

SQL Script:
from django.contrib.auth.models import User 
user = User.objects.get(username="test")
user.is_staff = True
user.is_admin = False
user.save()

when user logs in admin panel it will say test has no access to view anything 
since admin status is set to False.
